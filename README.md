### Hi, nice to meet you :) 

I'm Lucas Ambar, but you can call me Ambar. I'm currently learning full-stack development with JavaScript and his libraries: **React** and **Node**. Not only that, but I also study statistics and business at UFMG. Some day I'll join both worlds and specialize in data science.Â
